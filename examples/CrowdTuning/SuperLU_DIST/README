# Crowd-tuning for SuperLU_DIST.

There are prepared experiment scripts for crowd-tuning of SuperLU_DIST.

The experiemnts assume NERSC's Cori machine using 4 Haswell nodes. If the user
has no access to NERSC's Cori machine, or if the user needs to use a different
number or a different type of compute nodes, the user should modify the related
scripts. The user might need to update SuperLU_DIST files for a different
software configuration setting.

Note that, our crowd-tuning API requires users to provide an API key. Users can
obtain an API key here (sign-up and log-in required)

# Experiment 1. Run a Sobol sensitivity analysis using performance data in our
repository.

Step 1. Export your crowd-tuning API key to be used by the script

$ source CROWDTUNE_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Step 2. Export crowd-tuning API and GPTune package links

$ source env.sh

Step 3. Run the prepared script.

$ python ./sensitivity_analysis.py

# Experiment 2. Crowd-tuning of SuperLU_DIST, tuning SuperLU_DIST using
performance data (collected for a different matrix) from our crowd-tuning
repository at https://gptune.lbl.gov/repo/dashboard.

Step 1. Allocate compute nodes to run the experiment.

Step 2. Export your crowd-tuning API key to be used by the script

$ source CROWDTUNE_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Step 3. Run the prepared script.

$ ./run_tuning_cori.sh

Step 4. Generate plots to compare different tuning options.

$ python analyze_tuning_result_H20.py

# Experiment 3. Run a manual performance analysis, measuring and analyzing
performance on varying one parameter value.

Step 1. Allocate compute nodes to run the experiment.

Step 2. Run the prepared script.

$ ./run_maual_cori.sh

Step 3. Generate plots to analyze the performance

$ python analyze_manual_result_Si5H12.py
